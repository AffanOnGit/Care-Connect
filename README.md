# CareConnect

**CareConnect** is a full-featured, role-based clinic management system designed to help small clinics like *Dr. Taliyah’s Clinic* streamline their operations, improve patient care, and enable seamless collaboration between reception, doctors, pharmacists, and patients.

This project was born out of the need for a simple, scalable, and secure application that empowers local medical practices with professional tools—without the complexity or cost of enterprise systems.
